The main library is distributed under LGPL v2.1 or later. But it
relies on MAGE for better responsiveness. MAGE is distributed under
GPL v3 or later, so the combination is under GPL v3 or later. If you
want to use the library in your program under GPL v2 or LGPL, compile the
library without MAGE.

The following restrictions apply to some of the voices:
